      Giant pandas are apart of the bear family. They typically consume 
      only bamboo, being able to eat a lot of it because it has little 
      nutrition. They do not hibernate because their diet doesn't have 
      the necessary fat content for them to hibernate. They are very good 
      climbers and swimmers. They'll spend 10-16 hours every day eating.
