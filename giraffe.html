      Giraffes are the tallest mammals on our planet. They're known
      for their extremely long necks. Despite how long their necks 
      actually are, they aren't long enough to reach the ground normally,
      hence why they tend to spread their legs oddly to reach the ground.
      They'll spend most of their lives stood up. Their spots are unique, 
      with no two giraffes having the same exact spots.
