      Gorillas are one of humans closest living relatives. They are very
      intelligent and emotional. They're the largest great ape (larger 
      than orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans). They have social
      structures, often living as families. They are significantly stronger 
      than humans, with silverback gorillas being 4 to 10 times stronger 
      than the average human.
